1) Grab the "pathway-tools/ptools-local/pgdbs/user" directories 

2) Configure the "dump.sh" script to indicate the correct versions of 
   the "data" directories 

3) Update the "conf/gramene.yaml" file to indicate new pathway search dbs

4) Configure "load-search.sh" to load the output from #2

5) Run "../search/load-search.pl --like pathway"
