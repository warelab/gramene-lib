Creating text/mysql dumps of databases
=====================

Usage

This script MUST be run on cabot (or colden, but don't run it on colden), since mysqldump's
text option requires a local directory on the server, for some asinine reason.

You need to set two environment variables - 

export GRMVAR=current_gramene_release
export DUMPDIR=path_to_dump_directory

then run it.

./gramene.dbdumper.sh database database2 database3 ...

listing whichever databases you want to dump out.

Step 2:
Beer.

The script is fairly magical. It may prompt you for your ssh passwords, or for root authorization.
If so, give it to it (I'd recommend running it under ssh-agent for simplicity's sake). It'll automatically
create the directories on brie4, compress and scp everything over, and clean up after itself.

It'll tell you if there are any problems, but mostly it's just run and forget it.
