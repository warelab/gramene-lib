To build the Gramene ontology db:

1) Update "fetch.sh" to download the OBO files to a build directory.

2) Edit and run "create-amigo.sh" to load OBO files into an Amigo db.
   This will probably take a long time.

3) Run "amigo-load-check.pl" to check the current db's numbers with 
   the previous.

4) Edit and run "initialize-ontology-db.sh" to create a new Gramene
   ontology db with default data.

5) Run "load-from-amigo.pl" to load the Gramene ontology db from Amigo.

6) Run "export-ontology-assocs.pl" to export Ensembl, etc., ontology 
   associations to GAF files for the FTP site and for the next step.

7) Run "load-associations.pl" to load the associations from the previous 
   step.  Check the "obsolete-terms.txt" file for dbs to update.
