Gramene's rickety GFF dumper
=====================

This is probably obsolete, since it looks like EBI is now generating GFF3 files, since release 19 last year.

So I vote you go download 'em from ftp.ensemblgenomes.org and slap them onto brie4 as part of the release instead.

If there are any issues, fall back on this.

This thing dumps out our ensembl databases (as listed in the registry) to GFF3 format,
suitable for copying to the ftp server. It never works properly. Ever.

There will always be some connection issue, some problem with the database, some invalid
format. Something. I'm so so sorry.

Sharon can help with database issues, usually. Email her whatever the dumper bitched about
and cross your fingers.

Running it
-------

#create an output dir first, or it'll just spit out to /tmp.
./gff3_dumper.pl --output_dir=/path/to/output

It'll report progress as it goes along. When you see it print SUCCESS! it's like the clouds
parting and angels descending to sing to you. It's awesome. That'll happen on about the 5th run.

From there, scp 'em to the directory on brie4, which is currently something like:
brie4:/var/ftp/pub/gramene/CURRENT_RELEASE/data/gff/


Note that CURRENT_RELEASE is a symlink and may not properly exist. It might be easier to toss it
into the releaseXX directory instead.


Troubleshooting
---------------

Good luck. When it breaks, and it will break, it'll always break differently. It is a brittle
beast.
