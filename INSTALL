It's probably best to just unpack the source into a directory like 
"/opt/gramene."  You'll want to set your environment's "GrmConfPath" to 
the location of the "gramene/conf/gramene.yaml" file.  All should be good
if you do this:

 $ source gramene.env

You could add this to your .bashrc file to have it done automatically:

  GRMRC=/path/to/gramene-lib/gramene.env
  if [ -e "$GRMRC" ]; then
    source "$GRMRC"
  fi

To make sure all the dependencies are installed, do:

 $ perl Build.PL
 $ ./Build installdeps
 
To run tests:

 $ ./Build test
